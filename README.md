# Birthday

This is a small gem that hooks into ActiveRecord and allows to tag a database field (date or datetime) as birthday, allowing to find birthdays with ease.

## How To Install

After the gem has been properly tested, it will be released on RubyGems, and will be available to be installed with:

    gem install birthday


Until then, you have to either clone a git repository and build the gem yourself, or add this line to your Gemfile:

    gem 'birthday', :git => 'git://github.com/railslove/birthday.git'

## Synopsis

Will update readme as soon as possible. Until then, look into the [self-explanatory tests](https://github.com/railslove/birthday/blob/master/spec/birthday_spec.rb) (and `schema.rb`)

This gem is not release-ready yet.
