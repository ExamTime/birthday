# Birthday

This is a small gem that hooks into ActiveRecord and allows to tag a database field (date or datetime) as birthday, allowing to find birthdays with ease.

## How To Install

After the gem has been properly tested, it will be released on RubyGems, and will be available to be installed with:

    gem install birthday

or in your Gemfile:

    gem 'birthday', '~> 0.0.2'

## Synopsis

Read [a blog post about the gem](http://blog.railslove.com/2011/10/17/birthday-gem-easy-anniversaries-handling-ruby/) at Railslove blog to get a comprehensive guide to usage of this gem.

You can create your own adapters for the ORM adapters we're not supporting yet by writing a class with a class method `scope_hash`, which will return a hash normally used in `active_record` scopes.

    module Railslove
      module Acts
        module Birthday
          module Adapter
            class SqliteAdapter
              def self.scope_hash(field, date_start, date_end)
                # do some magic and return scope hash you can use
                # field is the field used in the database
                # date_start and date_end can be anything that responds to .to_date method
              end
            end
          end
        end
      end
    end

With this namespacing (`Railslove::Acts::Birthday::Adapter`) and naming the class after `active_record`'s ORM adapter (like `SqliteAdapter` in the example above) you can automatically use your own adapters with this gem.
